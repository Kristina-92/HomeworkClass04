        Task 5: The Farm Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
        In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:
    <ul>
        <li>chickens = 2 legs</li>
        <li>cows = 4 legs</li>
        <li>pigs = 4 legs</li>
    </ul>

        The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

        <h3>
            Examples:
        </h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36</li>
            <li>animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22</li>
            <li>animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Notes:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't forget to return the result.</li>
        <li>The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).</li>
        <li>Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number of animals.</li>
    </ul>
